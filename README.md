This repository hosts all the code and report for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project.

Project Overview: The dataset used in this project simulates customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Periodically, Starbucks sends out offers to users, which can range from simple advertisements to actual incentives such as discounts or buy-one-get-one-free (BOGO) offers. Not all users receive the same offer, presenting a challenge to determine which demographics respond best to which offer types. This dataset is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app, focusing on a single product scenario.

Problem Statement :Â¶ Predicting which purchase offers will elicit a higher level of response, such as 'offer received', 'offer viewed', 'transaction', and 'offer completed', based on both demographic attributes of customers and other characteristics of the company's offers.

Installations: This project is implemented in Python, using Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda. The essential Python packages utilized include:

pandas numpy math json matplotlib seaborn sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module) sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler) File Descriptions:

Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the project code. Capstone-Project-Report.pdf: Report detailing the project methodology, findings, and conclusions. Data: profile.json portfolio.json transcript.json: Data obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/blacktile/starbucks-app-customer-reward-program-data). The transcript.json file cannot be uploaded here due to its size exceeding GitHub's file size limit of 25MB. This project aims to apply data science techniques to understand customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies within the Starbucks rewards program, demonstrating practical applications of machine learning and predictive analytics in real-world business scenarios.
